# Event Bus Implementation Strategy

## Core Concept
The event bus is a central communication mechanism between components following the pub/sub pattern.

### Components
- **Event Types**: Constants for all event names  
- **Event Bus**: Central registry for publish/subscribe  
- **Event Emitters**: Components that trigger events  
- **Event Listeners**: Components that react to events  

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Event Bus Setup
- Implement `.on()`, `.off()`, and `.emit()` methods  
- Add debugging capability for event tracing  
- Test with simple events  

### Step 2: Component Communication Flow
- **SVG Selection**:  
  User selects SVG → `SVG_SELECTED` event emitted → Store updates → UI refreshes

- **SVG Display**:  
  User clicks quadrant → `COMMAND_DISPLAY_SVG` event emitted → SVG Service processes → Active SVG added to store → UI updates

- **SVG Visibility Toggle**:  
  UI button clicked → `COMMAND_TOGGLE_SVG_VISIBILITY` emitted → Store updates → UI refreshes

### Step 3: Command Event Pattern
- Command events (prefixed with `COMMAND_`) request actions  
- Services listen for command events and execute business logic  
- Services then emit state change events  
- Components listen for state changes and update UI  

---

## Testing Strategy
- Add console logging to event emissions and subscriptions  
- Test each event flow with mock data  
- Verify full cycle:  
  UI action → event emission → service handling → state change → UI update  

---

## Event Flow Visualization
```
UI Action 
  → Command Event 
    → Service Handler 
      → State Update 
        → State Change Event 
          → UI Update
```

---

## Debugging Aids
- Add timestamps to event logs  
- Log event data payloads  
- Use `[EVENT]` tag prefix in logs  
- Monitor component mount/unmount events  

---

This pattern enforces separation of concerns and creates a predictable, traceable data flow throughout the application.
