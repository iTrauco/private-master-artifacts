# Refactoring Plan for OBS Hardware Overlay - overlay.js

**Branch name recommendation:** `refactor/overlay-js-modular`

## Current Issues
- Hardware metrics not updating in real-time
- Panels overlapping with navigation elements
- overlay.js becoming too large and difficult to maintain

## Modular Architecture Approach

### 1. Directory Structure
```
public/js/
  ├── modules/               # Modular components 
  │   ├── cpu-panel.js       # CPU panel functionality
  │   ├── gpu-panel.js       # GPU panel functionality
  │   ├── system-panel.js    # System info panel functionality
  │   ├── charts.js          # Chart drawing utilities
  │   └── data-service.js    # Data fetching and processing
  ├── navigation.js          # Navigation functionality
  └── main.js                # Main entry point (renamed from overlay.js)
```

### 2. Component Breakdown

#### data-service.js
- Responsible for fetching hardware data from API
- Uses events to notify components when new data is available
- Provides error handling and retry mechanisms

#### charts.js
- Common utility functions for drawing charts
- Gradient generators
- Canvas sizing utilities

#### cpu-panel.js
- Renders and updates CPU panel
- Subscribes to data update events
- Handles CPU-specific UI

#### gpu-panel.js
- Renders and updates GPU panel
- Subscribes to data update events
- Handles GPU-specific UI

#### system-panel.js
- Renders and updates system information
- Subscribes to data update events
- Handles system-specific UI

#### main.js
- Initializes all modules
- Manages panel visibility toggling
- Handles global UI controls

### 3. Implementation Strategy

1. **Extract Data Service**
   - Move data fetching logic to data-service.js
   - Implement event-based updates
   - Keep skeleton code with minimal implementation

2. **Extract UI Components**
   - Create skeleton implementations for each panel module
   - Define clear interfaces between modules
   - Implement event listeners for data updates

3. **Refactor Chart Drawing**
   - Move chart-related functions to charts.js
   - Create reusable drawing utilities
   - Keep minimal implementation

4. **Update Main Entry Point**
   - Rename overlay.js to main.js
   - Initialize all modules
   - Keep core UI toggle functionality

### 4. CSS Improvements
- Adjust panel positioning to avoid overlaps
- Create proper spacing for navigation elements
- Ensure clean UI with proper z-indexing

### 5. Testing Points
- Verify real-time data updates are working
- Ensure panels don't overlap with navigation
- Check that all controls function properly
- Confirm exit button works in Electron context

### 6. Future Enhancements
- Add configuration options for update frequency
- Implement local storage for panel positions
- Add color theme options
- Create presets for different monitoring scenarios

## Implementation Notes
- Keep all code as skeleton implementations
- Focus on architecture rather than detailed implementations
- Maintain modular structure for easier future development
- Use event-based communication between components
